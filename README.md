Haupia
=================
## a tasty little component library by Jeff Yaus

About
-----
Haupia is a component library designed to be simple to use, to install, and to modify. 
It is made from **just pure CSS**, meaning **no build steps**, no JavaScript dependencies, no CSS processing to configure, no image directory to set up. 
While maybe not as feature-rich as some libraries, Haupia is ideal when you just want to get going with a minimum of fuss. 
Just drop the stylesheet onto your page, and you're off! 

Installation
-----
Just download the .css file, link to it on your page, and that's it! Go (coco)nuts!

Usage
----
Documentation and examples at [https://jyaus.github.io/haupia/](https://jyaus.github.io/haupia/)

Browser Support
----
Haupia uses CSS custom properties (variables) and CSS filters, so has full support from any browser that supports both, which is [most modern browsers](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables).
(Older browsers get a fallback version that's functional, if visually unexciting.)
